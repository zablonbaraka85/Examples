Misra Reachability Algorithm

This example is built around a simple sequential algorithm by Jayadev
Misra for computing the set of nodes in a directed graph thaa are
reachable from a given node.  It includes a multiprocess algorithm
that implements Misra's algorithm and TLAPS checked proofs that the
two algorithms satisfy their safety property.  Proofs are in separate
modules so the algorithms can be read independently from the proofs.
Here is what each module contains, in the order one might want to read
them.

Reachable
   Misra's algorithm written in PlusCal, its correctness properties, and
   an informal proof of its correctness.

Reachability
   The TLA+ definitions of a directed graph and reachability.
   It is imported by module Reachable.

ParReach
   The parallel implementation of Misra's algorithm written in PlusCal
   and the TLA+ formulation of the assertion that it implements
   Misra's algorithm under a suitable refinement mapping.

ReachableProofs
   The TLAPS checked proofs that the algorithm of module Reachable
   satisfies its desired safety property.  The proof assumes some
   properties of reachability in a directed graph.

ReachabilityTest
   Defines operators that TLC can use to check the correctness of the
   properties of directed graphs assumed by the proofs in module
   ReachableProofs.

ParReachProofs
   A TLAPS checked proof that the parallel algorithm of module ParReach
   implements the safety part of Misra's algorithm, under the refinement
   mapping defined in that module.

ReachabilityProofs
   TLAPS checked proofs of the reachability properties used in the proofs
   of module ReachableProofs.
